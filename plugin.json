	"longdescription": "This plugin uses z3 and a binary search to deoptimize divisions and modulos in binary ninja. It operates on MLIL, so it should be architecture agnostic. Because z3 is used and instructions are followed, the division deoptimization is also pattern agnostic, so different compiler optimizations should still work.",
